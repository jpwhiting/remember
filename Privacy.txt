Remember - A Remember The Milk application for N9

Remember 0.0.1 stores a key once you log in and allow the Application to access
your Remember The Milk tasks so that it can fetch your lists every time you
run the application.  Username and passsword are not stored in any way on your
device.  If you do not want Remember to store the key to access your account,
you can choose "Log out" from the bottom menu at any time.  If you no longer
want Remember to be able to access your tasks, lists, and other data, you can
use the Remember The Milk website to revoke access by visiting: Settings,
Services and revoking access to Remember.

Currently your tasks, lists, and any other data associated with your
Remember The Milk account is not stored on your N9 at all in any way.  Every
time the Remember application is run it downloads lists, tasks, and all other
information from the network.
